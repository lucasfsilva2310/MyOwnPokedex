This is a simple project containing all of the first 151 pokémon, and their description/stats. It´s just a simple project for studying purposes :)

## Getting Started

I´m using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for this project. So every information about pokemon inside this app was request whitin this API.

I also organized every component using the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) design system, which I found a little bit confusing at first, but now I really enjoy using it.

All of the Images that I used I simply google it, so you can do it yourself if you want to :). It´s really easy.

### Prerequisites

What you essentially need to know about the API is that you will only need one URL to make it all work.

`http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/POKEMON_ID`

So if you type any number between 1 and who_knows_how_many_pokemon_exists_in_these_days, you´ll get all the info you need, including images for every generation, moves, descriptions etc. Have fun!
